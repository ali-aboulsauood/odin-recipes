        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <b><dfn>Lasagna</dfn></b>, also known as <b>lasagne</b> is a type of pasta - possibly one of the oldest - made in the form of very wide, flat sheets.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Italian cuisine, it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings, such as ragù, Béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, seasonings and spices.
            The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (<i>al forno</i>).
            The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.
